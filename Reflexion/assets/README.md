# Assets Folder

This folder should contain the following image assets for the Expo app:

## Required Assets

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024 px)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen image (1284x2778 px for iPhone 13 Pro Max)
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon (1024x1024 px)
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon (48x48 px)

## Important Note

**These image assets are currently missing!** The app will still work in development mode, but you may see warnings in the console about missing assets.

To add proper assets:
1. Create or design the required images
2. Place them in this directory with the exact names listed above
3. Restart the Expo development server

## Quick Solution

For testing purposes, you can:
1. Create simple colored square images with the required dimensions
2. Use online tools like Canva or Figma
3. Or temporarily ignore the warnings - the app will still function

## Recommended Design

For the Neon Tap game, consider:
- Dark background (#1a1a2e)
- Neon cyan (#4ECDC4) or neon pink (#FF6B9D) colors
- Glowing effects
- Modern, minimalist style
